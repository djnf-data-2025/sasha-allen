In 2022, one in three students were at risk of dropping of dropping out, and chronic absenteeism continues to be an issue. Despite this, Connecticut has increased spending on education over the past decade. 

## So, what's going on in Connecticut schools?

The state is undergoing what they call the Disconnected Youth Crisis. Students are struggling in multiple aspects of school, and these struggles have long-term consequences. As a result, young people are not entering the job market or pursuing higher education after either dropping out or graduating. 

The state created a method of looking at the overall performance of their schools called the Next Generation Accountability System which is based off of 12 broad factor indicators of student performance:

- Academic achievement status measured by state assessments
- Academic growth
- Assessment participation rate
- Chronic absenteeism
- Postsecondary preparation - coursework
- Postsecondary readiness – exams and college credit
- Graduation – on track in ninth grade
- Graduation – four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate – all students
- Graduation – six-year adjusted cohort graduation rate – high needs
- Postsecondary entrance rate – all students (college enrollment)
- Physical fitness
- Arts access

Each school has a point maximum based on the opportunities and level of school, and is given a score and an accountability index, or the percent of the total maximum points earned, to gauge what level a school or district is at.

## Funding levels continue to rise as student test scores fall.
Connecticut has increased spending on education over the past decade. Despite this, students in the state are not performing well. In 2022, one in three students were at risk of not graduating high school according to a report released in October of 2023.

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;"><iframe title="[ Insert title here ]" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-oGIL8" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oGIL8/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="323" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
</script></div>

## How does this compare nationally?

Connecticut spends more on education than most states across the nation. But how much exactly are they spending, and what is the national average for per-pupil spending on education?

<iframe title="Per-pupil funding across the U.S. in FY 2023" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-fqLP2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fqLP2/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="507" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
</script>

## State actions 

This story is extremely timely because this issue has been brought to light in the past two years. A report was published in October of 2023 detailing the failures of the state, and this report has sparked the introduction of legislation into the Connecticut Senate. The legislation proposed an increase in funding for at-risk students and better data collection methods and data collaboration.

The target audience for this story is anyone in Connecticut who is in the school system or knows anyone involved in the school system including parents, teachers, students, family members and friends of students. This way, they can be more informed on what the state is trying to do as well as the contributing factors to the crisis.

## Highly effected districts

<iframe title="Worst performing school districts in 2021" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-NRdeZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NRdeZ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="769" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
</script>

## People to interview 

- Rep. Anthony L. Nolan,  introduced a bill to increase education funding. 
- Donna Hamzy, helped craft the Young People's Plan, which is a ten year plan for funding to help the crisis. 
- State Department of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker
- Someone who testified during the legislative hearings could be a good place to start finding people closely connected to the issue, preferably a student who has experienced disconnection in the school system. (<https://www.cga.ct.gov/aspx/CGADisplayTestimonies/CGADisplayTestimony.aspx?bill=SB-01511&doc_year=2025>)

This could possibly impact the funding for education, although it seems like there is already some initiative to change policy. Hopefully from this more nonprofits will be able to help supplement in high need areas from this as well.

I was mainly interested in this story because I had never heard of the disconnected youth crisis before and for a rich state known for having a fairly good education system, and wondered why so many students were at risk of dropping out. 

Estimated delivery is beginning of July.
