Students in Connecticut are failing. In 2022, one in three students were at risk of not graduating high school, and chronic absenteeism rates are currently at some of the highest levels the state has seen. Despite this, local, state and federal government are spending more money per-student on the education system than they ever have. Spending in Connecticut hit $19,734 per-student in the 2021 to 2022 school year sitting over $1,000 higher than the national average of $18,614 per student. (https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66#:~:text=Response%3A,constant%202022%E2%80%9323%20dollars).&text=This%20amounts%20to%20an%20average,fall%20of%20that%20school%20year.)

The state has coined this as the Disconnected Youth Crisis, with consequences that lead to young people not entering the job market or pursuing higher education after either dropping out or graduating. The state created a method of looking at the overall performance of their schools called the Next Generation Accountability System which is based off of 12 broad factor indicators of student performance. Each school has a point maximum based on the opportunities and level of school (ex elementary schools have lower maximum points because they don't have graduation rates). In this data is the accountability index, or the percentage of the total number of possible points a school was able to get based on their ELA, math and science test scores, split up by overall test performance as well as the performance index for high-needs students. Other factors are also taken into consideration, but these are the main ones. However, despite heightened spending in the state on students, the accountability index state-wide has been increasing dramatically.

This story is extremely timely because this issue has been brought to light in the past two years. A report was published in October of 2023 detailing the failures of the state, and this report has sparked the introduction of legislation into the Connecticut Senate. The legislation proposed an increase in funding for at-risk students and better data collection methods and data collaboration.

The target audience for this story is anyone in Connecticut who is in the school system or knows anyone involved in the school system including parents, teachers, students, family members and friends of students. This way, they can be more informed on what the state is trying to do as well as the contributing factors to the crisis.

People to interview are: Rep. Anthony L. Nolan, he introduced a bill to increase education funding. Donna Hamzy, helped craft the Young People's Plan, which is a ten year plan for funding to help the crisis. Someone who testified during the legislative hearings could be a good place to start finding people closely connected to the issue, preferably a student who has experienced disconnection in the school system. (<https://www.cga.ct.gov/aspx/CGADisplayTestimonies/CGADisplayTestimony.aspx?bill=SB-01511&doc_year=2025>)

This could possibly impact the funding for education, although it seems like there is already some initiative to change policy. Hopefully from this more nonprofits will be able to help supplement in high need areas from this as well.

I was mainly interested in this story because I had never heard of the disconnected youth crisis before and for a rich state known for having a fairly good education system, and wondered why so many students were at risk of dropping out. I think it will be impactful to see who this actually is effecting the most, and what types of supports are offered in these areas.

Photo and graphics: I have my double-axis graph comparing state per-pupil funding and , but I also want to create an interactive choropleth map based on the accountability index where you click on a town and are able to see the graduation rate, per-pupil funding and accountability index compared directly to the state averages.

Estimated delivery is beginning of July.
